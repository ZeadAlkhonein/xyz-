This [Udacity clone project](https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-DeepLearning.git)  is to  learn  how to build a neural network
 and how all the individual pieces function together to form a powerful decision-making drone machine.

**TensorFlow**  which is a robust software framework developed by Google to facilitate building deep neural networks is 
used to abstract away many of the finer details and make life easier are used in this project. However, it is important 
to have a firm grasp of the fundamentals to understand the choices needed to make in setting various parameters or 
how to improve the performance of the neural network.
